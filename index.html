    <h1>Chapter 45: Events: link</h1>
    <!-- Why Events  -->
     <!-- A good website is a resposive website. The user does 
     something-clicks a button,
     moves the mouse, presses a key-and something happens. Javascript
     gives you many ways to
     respond to the user's needs.

     Real world Examples:
     1. The user clicks a button saying "Our Gurantee" and an alert displays spelling out
     the Gurantee.

     2.A page displays a "before" picture of model. when the user mouses over the 
     picture , it is replaced by an "after" picture of her.

     3. The user types a number in the MILES field  on a form . when she clicks in the 
     KILOMETERS field, the equivalent in KILOMETERS displays.

     4. The user has entered her email address in a form, and is about to type a comment.
     when she moves the cursor from the email field to the comment field, Javascript checks
     to see if the email address is valid. In this case, it isn't-she's omitted ".com" at
     the end of the address . A message displays letting her know that she's entered an 
     invalid email address.

     5.On an online shopping site, there's a picture of a black watch. next to it is a 
     drop-down list asking the user to choose a color . when she choose , the color of the
     watch in the picture changes to that color . -->

     <!-- What are Events  -->
      <!-- All of these user actions-clicking a button , moving the mouse , moving from one  
      field to another in a form , selecting a different option-are known as events. -->

      <!-- links we've used so far in html 
      <a href="www.google.com">Google</a><br>
      <a href="www.w3school.com">W3 school</a> -->

      <!-- inline event handling
      inline event-handling means that you combine bits of Javascript with HTML markuup.

      Note: we won't be using inline event-handling . we'll be using scripting approach
      that is we'll write Javascript in a seperate file same as we did for css.
      <a href="#" onClick="alert('hi')">Click</a>
      <a href="#" onClick="alert('hi')">say hi</a>
      <a href="#" onClick="console.log('hi')">say Hi</a> -->

      <!-- Warning  -->
       <!-- But there's a problem with the markup above . <a href="#" tells the browser to
       reload the page. This means that if the user has scrolled down to the link , the click,
       in addition to running the javascript code, will scroll the page back to the top-an
       action you don't normally want. I've included this flawed approach, using <a href="#" ,
       because you'll run into here and there in other people's work , but you'll probably
       prefer this approach:

       Do this Instead -->
       <!-- <a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="alert('hi');">click</a> -->

       <!-- call a function from script on link click  -->
        <!-- <a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onclick="greeting()">click</a>
        <script>
            function greeting() {
                alert("hello");
            }
        </script> -->
